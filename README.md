# SimProfiler

This repository contains Matlab codes designed to simulate sampling of oceanographic data fields by a profiling instrument (such as a [moored profiler](http://mclanelabs.com/mclane-moored-profiler/)  or [CTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTD_(instrument))) at a fixed location. These profiles are usually assumed to be measured instantaneously. However, making a depth profile takes a finite amount of time, during which the field it is sampling may change. These codes are designed to estimate that effect based on the profiling speed.
